SPEAKER 0
There's space in the front row. Can you uh needs a seat.

SPEAKER 1
By the way, we don't ask questions from anyone in the front row, we always. Yeah. Yeah Alright, um, good afternoon everyone.

SPEAKER 0
Welcome to Riot 6811, uh, Research Methods. Um, it's great to see such a packed room. Um, there's a couple of spots left at the front, uh, for latecomers. If there's a couple of spots at the front. Um, so my name's Alina Berkowski, and I'll be coordinating this course and taking approximately half of the lectures, um, and, uh, today's lecture is all about giving you an overview of the course, the requirements, the assessment, um, and giving an introduction to what research methods is all about. Um, so I'd like to begin with an acknowledgement of country. So I'd like to acknowledge the First Nations people as the original inhabitants and the traditional owners of the land on which this course was developed. This land is Mianjin, also known as Brisbane. We pay deep respects to all elders past, present, and emerging on this land and the lands from which we are presenting. So this lecture is split into two parts. The first part is more administrative, talking about the course structure and the expectations, and I think mostly also about the assessment, which is what students are most interested in. The second part will be more into the introduction to the course and research methods. So in terms of an overview of the course, um, hopefully you've all had a chance to skim through the course profile or course instance as it's now called, um, the purpose of this course is to introduce you to research and project work. For many of you, uh, you're going to be doing a thesis as part of your degree, um, and this course helps prepare you for that. Um, so a lot of the topics help you prepare, um, so there are some aspects related to academic writing, um, all the way through to how you conduct research from proposals through to communication of your results. Um, in terms of how we describe the course, um, we describe it as research methodology and research tools for computer science and engineering. And so we teach the theoretical and practical material for starting, supporting and advancing research project work. It is recommended to do this in your first semester at UQ as part of a master's degree, um, and, uh, typically it's taken as a companion to the first semester of a two semester project. Um, so the course codes this year have changed, as you may have noticed, um, so previously they were course coded with ing at the start, um, even this course code itself used to be EG 7811. Um, now it's all renamed to RI, uh, which stands for, uh, research, and, um, you can see the link to the thesis coursework. Um, the web page is the same as for every course here at UQ, which is learn.uq.edu.au. That's what we call Blackboard, um, and that's where you can access all of the materials for this course as well as the lecture recordings and, uh, the tutorials, as well as assessment materials. Um, and if you want to have more details of the course profile, that's available at the following link. So I'd like to start off by introducing the course staff. Um, so we have a massive cohort this semester, the largest we've ever had of students in the course. Um, for reference, last year when I ran this course, we had 130 students. This semester, I've been kind of stressfully watching the numbers rise to 300 students. Um, so that's more than a 2 times increase. Um, and we have a very large teaching team to support your learning. Um, on this slide here, we have the course staff, so, um, Uh, there's myself, um, so I'm the coordinator and, uh, one of the lecturers, and, um, today we have Ley and Carl, um, as well. So I just give a brief introduction to myself. Um, so I've been at UQ since 2017. Um, my research is in the fields of computer vision and machine learning, um, for various applications, uh, mostly medical imaging related applications, um, but quite diverse things, uh, all the way through to, uh, biomechanics and even, Uh, analysing drone footage. Um, and I'll just welcome, uh, Lee, who will, uh, tell you a little bit about himself. Yeah. So my name is Lee.

SPEAKER 2
Uh, I'm a senior, I'm a senior lecturer, uh, in a group of imaging sensing and uh biomedical engineering. Um, so I begin my study, my, my life at UQ since 2010, which is like 15 years ago. So at that time, I was just like you guys are sitting. I was sitting in the room and uh I, I'm curious about everything at UQ and uh time flies so fast. Now I'm sitting in front in front of you guys and I'm going to give you 5 lectures in this course. Um, so, I think previously this lecture, this course is not compulsory. So based on our experience, the students who selected this course got a better performance in their thesis. So this course is very good for your thesis. So hopefully we'll have a good journey. Thank you.

SPEAKER 3
Hey, um, I'm Karl, and I've been at UQ since '99, so I started my undergrad degree and I never left, so I'm a bit rusted on. Um, so, um. I'm also the coordinator for for thesis project, so I'll probably be seeing a lot of you in that as well. So if you have any questions about that, come and talk to me as well. I'm primarily here so I, Um, to sort of, because there's an overlap between the, the material in thesis and this, and I'll be doing at least one of the lectures and supporting you guys as well via thesis.

SPEAKER 0
Um, so thanks so much, uh, Carl and Lee. Um, if you need to contact them for any reason, um, we have one email that goes to all of us, um, and that's listed here on the slides. So Ri at 6811@ EECS.uq.edu.au. Um, before they go, does anyone have any questions for them? No. Oh yeah, there's one at the back. A bigger theatre. Um, I will put a request through, yes, there's a couple of spots at the front, uh, for those of you who would like to sit down. Um, there's 4 seats there, um, and I don't, I don't need a seat, so there's 5 seats. So yeah, the, the course numbers have exceeded our expectations, um, so sorry about that. I'll I'll look into a bigger room, um, or other options we can do for, uh, getting more people into the room. Um, yeah, I, you're welcome to stay or you're welcome to, to, OK. Cool. And um we also have Professor Janet Wiles who'll be um also lecturing into the course, um so she'll be delivering one lecture, uh, and that's because she has the expertise in the um qualitative analysis. So within research there's many different areas of research, but also methodologies and um she brings that strength, um, particularly from her research in human centred computing, um, which requires a lot of qualitative uh analysis and methodologies, um, so she's gonna be providing the expertise there. We're also supported by a very large team of tutors, um, so their names are here, you're gonna get to know them very well, um, every week you'll be participating in the, uh, tutorial participation activities, and you'll be guided by one of these tutors. Um, many of them are very experienced. Um, from teaching into this course for approximately 5 semesters, um, but they all bring a diversity of experience and expertise to the course. Um, so many of them are doing PhDs, um, doing research and, uh, bring that to the course. In addition, um, we also have uh embedded language support, um, so that's through Stuart Crosby, um, his contact details are here, and um, he'll be helping with some of the English language. Um, so we have a very high proportion of international students here and one of the things that some people struggle with. Is actually how to communicate, which is pretty critical in research methods. So we have extra support for that, um, and he'll be doing some guest lectures as well, um, particularly around language support. Um, there'll be a couple of, uh, assessment helpers as well on the blackboard page, um, which we'll direct you to when they come around. OK, so in terms of the structure for this semester, so lectures are in person, um, I'm gonna look into if we can get some kind of larger room. Um, unfortunately space is limited and uh I'll see what what we can organise. Um, however, recordings will be available on Blackboard shortly after the lecture, so it automatically gets recorded, um, and you should be able to access everything that was delivered in the lecture. Uh, in addition, the slides will be available on Blackboard, um, and so hopefully you would have seen that, um, on the Blackboard page, you click into learning resources, lectures, and typically we upload those, uh, just before the lecture, um, we're aiming to have those ready a little bit earlier as well. In terms of the mode of delivery, this is an internal um delivery course, and um in particular the tutorials are on campus and uh attendance in those tutorials is critical because they are assessed. Um, in addition, there are 2 assignments and an end of semester exam. In terms of what we'll be covering this semester, I've uh created this overview of a week by week guide of what we'll be covering. So you can see um this corresponds to each week, so each row is one week, and there's the topic of the lecture, and then there's tutorials. You can see tutorials begin next week, um, and there are a total of, It's actually 9 tutorials in the last 2 weeks are reserved for assignment to presentations. In terms of what we're covering, you can see we start off with a bit of an introduction, then we go into topics such as research and academic integrity, through to how you go about literature review and how you appropriately reference materials, uh then going into, Um, measuring quality of research, um, or estimating that, um, through various metrics, then we'll be talking about proposals, um, so how you go about kind of the start of research, um, and going into methodology, so how you go about doing that. That flows directly into the data lectures, so that is all about how you use data to support, uh, your research. Um, then research with humans, and the last part is more about communication of results. So in research, um, the communication of results is both written and oral, um, and that's actually necessary to progress the field. Um, so communication is a critical part, and, um, you can see that the tutorials actually mostly mirror the content in the lectures. Um, we have one week where there'll be no tutorials, um, so you can see that in week 8, there's the public holiday on the Friday, and to not disadvantage any students, we've, uh, just cancelled tutorials for that whole week. Um, and the corresponding tutorial for the research with humans is actually pushed up to week 5, so the 4th. Tutorial. Um, so this might be a little bit difficult, but, um, the tutorial is standalone that you can do it without having done the lecture. Um, so it's more hypotheticals. You might have heard of things like the trolley problem, and so it's all those different considerations around, uh, ethics and how you go about thinking about research. In the last column you can see there's the assignment due dates. So, uh, we have 4 assessment items in this course. So one is the tutorial participation activities, so they run here. Then there's assignment 1, so that's due on the Monday of week 7. There's assignment 2, so there's two parts to that. There's the oral component, which is presentation, and you have to submit your slides on the Monday of week 12. Um, so that's to be fair to everyone, so everyone must submit their slides at the same time and then deliver them across weeks 12 and 13. And the written component of that assignment is due on the last day of semester, so Friday of week 13, um, 4 p.m. Then the end of semester exam is during exam period. Does anyone have any questions in terms of the schedule for this course? Yeah. When's assignment 1 and 2 released? Released, uh. That's a good question. Um, minimum, uh, 2 weeks in advance, but I can already tell you the details of assignment two. So assignment 2 will be a reflection of the whole course, um, and it'll be based off, um, the lecture journals that you do week to week. Um, so it'll be a kind of a reflective summary of your, um, journey through research methods. Assignment one will be more around the topics that we cover in the first semester. Um, we'll have that at least 2 weeks in advance, but I'm gonna aim to have that, um, as soon as possible. Thanks. Great question. Um, any other questions? So in terms of access to the course material, as I mentioned before, we use the Blackboard website to disseminate materials and also for submission of assessment. Um, so, uh, the lecture materials will all be available on Blackboard, and the recordings will also be available um to listen via Echo 360. In terms of the tutorials, um, we call that contact sessions or tutorials, those are, those terms are interchangeable. The idea is those tutorials extend upon the concepts that we cover in class. One challenge we have is that our lecture is now. So Wednesday 12 till 2. The first tutorials start straight after the lecture, so right at 2 p.m. I'm gonna try to finish 10 minutes in advance to give you enough time to get to the classes. Um, so you can see that here, lecture one, and then the tutorials 1 through to 11. They are not sequential. The reason for that is because every week the enrollment numbers have been Very rapidly increasing, so we've had to add a number of classes, um, so you can see that 1234, 10, 78956, 11. Um, so, uh, these are critical to attend, so make sure that, uh, you are allocated here. I have received a number of requests that people have clashes. Um, we are introducing one more class, um, so that's just awaiting. Uh, timetables to find a room and assign that to us, um, turns out that collaborative spaces are in very high demand across the university, um, but they will be able to find one for us and um I will email when that becomes available. Has everyone been able to allocate into one of the tutorials? Um, so I think most people have. I checked this morning and I think there's about 20 people still unallocated. Um, so do make sure to, to allocate yourself to one and make sure you're available to attend it as well. In terms of how we communicate to you, um, I send announcements via blackboard, and they get sent to your email address, so make sure to check your emails. Every announcement I assume that people have read, um, because it's, uh, typically for important announcements, so things that are critical for you to know. Um, we also have an ed discussion board, um, so hopefully you would have seen that already. There's a link on Blackboard to access that, um, and this link should take you there as well. Um, I think you can just typed STEM, and it'll take you to the website and then any courses that you're assigned to, you can just click there as well. Uh, so the predominant mode of communication, uh, for you guys to us is through the discussion board. If there's any private matters, you can mark yourself as, um, a private conversation, but if it's something for the whole class, um, you can mark yourself as an anonymous and make it publicly available because then it can assist the rest of the class and provide a consistent message to everyone. Um, if it's something that's more complicated or, uh, very private that you don't want on the discussion board, please email us at this email here. So some of you have already done that, um, it's on the course profile as well in case you forget it. Um, and so, uh, please email there. Um, in terms of a discussion, uh, there might be a delay in the response, so sometimes we get flooded, uh, in one of my other courses, typically I answer over 1000 of these, um, Uh, messages throughout the semester, but as you imagine, that does take a lot of time, um, and it's challenging to, you know, get an instant response back to people. Um, you know, sometimes you don't see the other private messages, um, there's sometimes a lot of admin behind the scenes, um, but we aim to get back to you, you know, within a reasonable time, so, um, if it's, you know, the assignment's due on Monday and you're sending something Friday after work hours, you might not get a response, so make sure to actually, um, Do things early, so if there's something that you need help with, ask early. Um, in addition, uh, so typically straight after this lecture, I have availability, um, I, I'm not sure about the other lecturers, but in general, you know, we're here on campus and accessible, so, um, I can have a, a, a consultation with you or through appointments, so just feel free to to message. And then tutorials, that's something that you're attending weekly and so you have a chance to ask questions to your tutor, so um. It's uh participation is strongly encouraged and in fact, mandatory because you get assessed on that, but you do have a chance to ask questions there as well. Um, in terms of email protocols, um, maybe you would have seen my announcement on Ed, um, just giving you a bit of a guide of how to write emails. So turns out not everyone is taught how to send an email, um, and actually there's a lot of things that you can do to help us, um, and so, in particular, the subject line can really help to identify what the issue. Search as well. Um, so make sure to include the course code in the subject. Um, many of us teach into other courses as well, so it just really helps to identify what the issue is about, plus make the subject about the subject of the email, so like what it's related to. So it might be, you know, absent from tutorial this week, it might be, you know, question about assignment one. if it is questions about the assignment, typically you'd ask it on edge so that the other, uh, teaching staff can get back to you faster. Also start with a greeting. Um, so this will depend on how well you know someone. Um, I'm happy for you guys to call me by my first name, but if you're unfamiliar with someone, typically you'd address them by their full name and title. So, um, for example, you know, Dear Professor Wiles, but, um, uh, you know, just double check before, um, and it depends on how well you know someone. Um, and, you know, double check for grammar and always finish with your full name and the student ID. That helps us if there's an issue that requires your student ID for us to find your identity and sort that issue out for you. And in fact, in previous years, there has been a question on the exam about this, um, which surprisingly, even though people were told about this, we didn't have a 100% success here, so like hopefully by the end you can actually um uh know how to do professional emails. So why is this important? Um, because, you know, typically academics get, I don't know if it's on the order of 100 a day, but easily 30 and all of them need to be actioned, um, plus tonnes. Yes. Is very important. Yes, yes, um, so that's so not just in academia or a student life, um, but in industry as well. So, um, hopefully that can help you in your professional life, wherever that may be in the future. In terms of assessment, um, this is a screenshot from the, um, course profile. You can see, as I mentioned before, that there are 4 assessment items, the participation activities, um, assignment 1, assignment 2, and the end of semester exam, and their weightings are in the weight column, so 30%, 20%, 20%, 30%. And in addition you can see some of the properties of those assessment items. So in particular, um, we have hurdles, that means you must pass them to pass the course, um, and we have hurdles on the participation. Um, so that means you need to get at least 50% overall, and assignment one and two, it's at least 50% across the two assignments. Um, so make sure you submit those. Um, we're gonna try to be on top of people who, you know, submit late, um, and really get you across the line. We don't want to fail people, so just make sure to, to do, uh, the best you can. So these are some of the requirements around passing the course. Um, so this is what's called a 2 unit course, um, and so that's kind of how much work it is, and at UQ we estimate that to be approximately 10 hours of work per week. That might be varied week to week, so maybe in assessment time it might be a bit more, but, um, you should have a think about if you're trying to balance work and studies that you will actually need to put in the time to do well in this course as well as your other courses. Um, so as a rough guide, it's around 10 hours per week, um, so you need to actually find the time to, to put in the work to do well in your assessment items. So attending the weekly lectures, we have lecture journals which I'll show you shortly, um, and so those will need to be completed by the end of the week, um, so some people might not be able to attend the lecture, but it's critical to keep up to date with the lectures because they'll help you with your tutorials which are assessed. Um, and in fact, uh, assignment 2 is all about a reflection of the materials you learn in the lectures. Um, then attend the weekly tutorials and participate well, so it's worth 30%. They start next week, and critically, the assessment for that is due at the before the end of your tutorial. Um, so make sure that you submit it. Um, it's also through the form of journals, which I'll also be talking about in more detail. One hopefully nice thing for you is that we take the best 8 out of 10 tutorials. That means that, for example, if you are unwell one week or maybe you're just, um, overwhelmed with all the other courses, you can, for example, not submit one. but I would strongly recommend you to, you know, do your best for each one so then you can take the best 8 out of 10. Um, so that factors in any illnesses, um, and other factors that might, um, prevent you from being able to. Do all 10. Um, and the last two weeks of semester for those assignment two presentations. Then the marking of criteria will be given with each assessment item. And as I mentioned before, you need to pass the hurdles, so that's at least 50% in the tutorial participation, um, and 50% across the two assignments. So this is just a copy paste from the course profile, um, and so. Uh, the rubric we're gonna be using is here, but more details will be in the actual tutorial sheet itself. Um, so you can see there's, uh, one mark for punctuality, so that's related to, you know, professionalism. Um, so then you have 4 marks that are, sorry this is out of 10, so 1 out of 10 is for punctuality, 4 out of 10 is for participating actively. So that means you can't just sit passively and expect, you know, the information to be downloaded into your brain. You need to actually participate. That means gaining that confidence to contribute to class discussion. And actually engage with the material. Um, so, you know, some people struggle with this at the start, but you're not the only one, and, um, we've actually observed people become really confident by the end in their tutorials. Um, so don't worry too much, we're here to support you, um, but you do need to participate in those activities to do well in this. Then there's the journal or the submission that you do at the before the end of your tutorial, and you're assessed on the accuracy of those answers and the quality as well. So you can see 1441 in terms of the distribution of those marks. You need to make sure you submit that before the end of your tutorial, so, um, we do have quite a strict penalty there where, you know, if you don't submit it before the end, um, it's a 100% late penalty because it's assessing your participation and activities within the class. Um, but to accommodate any circumstances, we take the best 8 out of 10. OK, then the other um assessment is assignment one, so that's a report format with 20% and assignment two, which is uh a presentation and a report. Um, so you can see the due dates here. Then there's a final exam, um, and that will be in exam block, um, so that's in June this year. And so that covers all the material that we've covered across the semester. So that's all the assessment, does anyone have any questions regarding assessment? We do not have any No, so there is not a hurdle in the final exam, so, uh, you do not need to pass it, um, but I believe to pass the course because it's worth 30%, you will need to actually sit it. But yes, no hurdle. So the question was what are you going to be tested on within the exam, so it's gonna cover all the topics covered across semester. You will literally have just done that as part of assignment 2, where you do a reflection on, um, all the content. Um, we'll be providing a sample exam to help you prepare, and also the last week of semester is all around helping you prepare for that as well. But it's basically all of the topics that we cover through the whole semester. So, you know, academic integrity, metrics, um, uh, things like, you know, proposals, um, the whole entire course. Um, and the, the format is written. Does that help answer your question? So, um, there'll be more details as we go, but, um, in terms of the format, uh, we're gonna be providing you with a sample, um, at the end of the semester so you can know the format, the types of questions that we'll ask, and kind of what the distribution of marks could be.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, last semester exam as well. Yes, so one thing to note is that this course

SPEAKER 0
in the past, Uh, I'm not sure exactly what year it had, uh, what assessment it had year to year, but, uh, in the past, I believe some years, it was just purely 3 assignments, and that was it. Um, other years there has been a final exam, and then in other years there's been, um, an in-semester, um, exam. So the library only stores end of semester exams. Um, in terms of where to find that it's the previous course code for this course, which was Ege 7811, so ENGG 7811. Um, so you can get an example of, uh, what the past exam was last year, um, the format should be fairly similar, um, but if there's any major changes, I'll let you know about that. Yes, so go to the library website and you should be able to find it. So this is a summary of the assessment for the course, so you can see the distribution, 30%, 20%, 20%, 30%. And also the due dates. Um, so for these, uh, weekly tutorial activities, it's effectively weeks 2 to 11 inclusive minus week 8, and then tutorial 10 is an optional one which runs at the same time as the presentations, so that's in week 12 and 13. Um, that's due at the start of week 7, and then assignment 2 is week 12 and 13, and the exam is in the exam block in June. So as Karl mentioned at the start, um, this course helps you prepare for any future research you have and in particular if you're doing a thesis project. Um, so that is a separate course code to this, but there is a fair bit of overlap in terms of the things we cover, and the aim is for this to help prepare you and support you in research activities. But saying that, this course does not help you find a thesis project. So instead you talk to the coordinator just call um and uh so how many people here are doing a thesis uh this semester? So that's. Yeah, not, not as many as I thought, um, so I think that was about maybe 10% of the class, um, but, uh, and how many people are going to be doing one as part of their degree? So a few more hands, um. I think I'm gonna guess core core unit. programme requirement. Oh, and how many people are interested in, for example, doing a PhD in the future? So kind of the same number but different distribution of hands. So interesting. Uh, what about the rest of you? Software engineer, um. Yeah, so what we're gonna be doing an activity shortly, um. And so we're gonna be discussing that amongst the class as well. Uh, in terms of, uh, thesis, there's a website on the internet. I always forget what it is, so I just search EECS thesis and it takes me to that correct page, um, and all the details about assessment and things are on that page, including the assessment items and criteria sheets, um. And there's also an associated a discussion board. Um, there's other resources like your supervisor, other people in the supervisor's group, and the UQ library is a massive treasure trove of information related to research. Um, so definitely visit that website if you're interested in more, uh, resources related to, uh, thesis and research. OK, so in terms of submission for this course, uh, I think this is fairly standard for most courses, but make sure that you include your name and your student number on every bit of assessment. Uh, we'll provide you with those instructions, but that's just expected of you. Um, also, you will only submit one file, um, and so there might be, you know, graphics that you have as part of your assessment, um, but you should only submit one file, so with all that included in the file. One thing that might be different from some of your other courses is that we're going to have submission through two portals, um, which is a little bit strange, but, um, we're gonna have you submit via both turn it in and grade scope. So if you're not familiar with that, don't worry, um, the submission links will be on Blackboard, but the reason we do that is, even though both of these companies, these uh software tools are actually owned by the same company, they provide different functionality and they don't cross-talk with one another. So Turnitin will help give you and us an indication of any potential plagiarism, um, so you can check that before you submit or as you submit, um, so I'll give you a report of the similarity. So let's say you are unfamiliar with uh academic and research integrity and you've accidentally put too much of other people's words in your report and for example, you may not have cited it, all the parts that match anything on the internet or previous submissions is going to be highlighted. That will give you an indication that you probably need to change up the wording, um, make it your own work and not other people's work, and that you cite correctly, um. And grade scope is just a really nice method of marking because you indicate where each of your answers is and it makes marking much faster, which is needed for a course of 300 students. Um, but don't worry, they will be very clearly marked in Blackboard when it's time for submission. Uh, I've already mentioned that with assignment too, so the, the assessment items will be due in weeks 12 and 13. And for the lecture and the tutorials, the submission mode is actually through something called journals. Um, that's a tool within Blackboard. Um, and the tutorial journals, as I mentioned, are due at the end of your tutorial every week, and the lecture journals are due by the end of the week. So that caters for people who aren't able to attend in person. So what are journals? Journals are a collaborative tool, uh, that can, uh, create greater interaction between you and the teaching staff. Um, so as part of a journal, there's lots of things that you can add, so typically text, but also you can add other resources like images, uh, PDFs, um, and so on. And they're a really good opportunity for you to reflect on your learning. Uh, so throughout the semester you're gonna be doing these lecture journals. So we're gonna have a bunch of activities. I try to signpost them well, so we have like a blue background for most of the slides where there's a journal activity. You answer those and put them in your journal, and then at the end of the semester for assignment 2, you'll be reflecting on your learnings from the lecture material plus those lecture journals. So who's heard of a journal, like, you know, like a diary, yeah, so I think most people, so it's, it's quite similar, um, so it's kind of just a record of reflections basically. Um, and so, uh, compared to something like a blog, those will only be visible to yourself and the teaching staff. So it's not visible by other students. So in terms of what that looks like, this is instructor view, so uh you won't have that little uh text underneath, but you can see there's little submission links, so you can click on these and it'll take you to the the journal submission. Um, so there'll be one journal for each week, and they'll become available, um, at the start of the week. And you're able to change and edit it, and there's a rubric which is already on blackboard for marking that. OK, so some Q&A around journals. So where do you submit them? If you go to Blackboard now, you can actually have a look. Um, so for, uh, tutorials, um, you go to the assessment link on the side of Blackboard, and then you click on the current week's tutorial. That's gonna be usually one offset from the actual week because we start in week 2. So tutorial one will be the first tutorial and you click Create journal entry. Then what do you write about? There'll be instructions as part of the tutorial handouts as well as the uh lectures which tell you what the questions are. For example, here, it might have been what is an H index and what is a JIF or GIF. Um, so that's journal impact factor. Oops sorry. And then can you attach any files? Yes, you can, and so you can do that through this button here. So if you make a mistake, are you able to resubmit? So the answer is no, you should go back and edit it. So it should be one entry per submission item, and you can do that as follows. So you can see that here. So I had a test run here, lecture one, and you can see there's an edit button there. So see that little downward link, so the arrow there that allows you to edit it. Um, can you submit 2 entries per week? No, just the one. Um, if you wanna add any additional comments, perhaps you're going back and reflecting on your previous journals, you can add comments and, um, you'll be able to see your results in my grades for those tutorials. So typically there'll be a one week delay in that, so you'll complete your tutorials, submit it by the end of your tutorial, and then, The participation activities typically can be almost on the spot, but we do some moderation during our teaching team meetings, and so those journals that you submit will be marked, um, shortly after, and typically your results will appear, uh, in the following week. That's an opportunity for you to get feedback and find out, you know, how did you go and, um, if, if it, if you. Disagree, for example, um, it's also an opportunity for you to have a quick discussion with your tutor around how you can improve. Um, so there'll be, you know, the grading rubric, so you can see the grades, and hopefully they'll give you a bit of an indication, and there's also a little comment field sometimes as well. But, you know, sometimes that might not make sense, so definitely seek out feedback if, if it doesn't make sense. Alright, so now we have our first journal activity. So this is our lecture journal activities, um, so you will require your laptops during class, um, so do make sure to bring those, you would definitely need them for the tutorials. If you don't have it here today, you should be able to do it through your phone or you can do it after the lecture. Maybe just uh record your answers in a notebook. So our first activity is to write a brief description about yourself, the degree you're doing, and how research methods could be helpful for you. Um, and so if we do that. So I'm gonna do it at the same time as you, so you go into learn.uq.edu.au you find our course code, so read at 6811. Assessment Sorry, learning resources lectures. This is the lecture journal. Yeah, so, um, so hopefully that's visible for you. It's called lecture journals and it has a little icon here that looks like a book, so that's supposed to mimic a journal. So you click here. And you can see that's taken you to the submission portal for the journal, for the lectures. The exact same thing exists for tutorials, so if you go to assessment instead, tutorials, this will have, uh, this is currently hidden because it will only open on the week of the tutorial, you'll see that you have the same thing, so tutorial one. And to start off with, you'd click create journal entry. So you can see 4 lectures, it's exactly the same as 4 tutorials, um, and so you click create journal entry. So here you'd call this lecture one. And you answer the questions here. So it's easier if you copy paste the questions, we're gonna do these activities sequentially, um. So you can do it like I've done, where you can copy paste the questions and then have your answer underneath. So Activity one is about writing a description about yourself, the degree you're doing and how research methods could be helpful to you. So, um, if everyone could do that activity, um, so this is kind of the start of your reflection, because I think it's important to think about why you're doing something. If you're not, if you don't have a purpose for something, you're gonna be much less engaged. Um, and so in some ways, don't worry if your answer, there's no such thing as a wrong answer here. In previous years, most people say it's a compulsory course, that's why I'm doing it, that's completely OK. Um, but you should have a think about, you know, what, what, why are you doing it? Are there, are there some specific aims you have, um, so. So I've just, uh, completed that activity, it might take you a bit longer, especially if you're doing some thinking associated with that. Um, so here's just, you know, just a short answer. So this is just a guide of what you could write. Um, so I've just made this up, but other than my degrees, I actually did a Bachelor of Engineering and a PhD, um, and then just those three questions.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, wait until we get to them. Yeah, so don't, don't, uh, respond to the remaining activities, um, just the first activity for now. So a brief description about yourself, the degree you're doing, and how research methods could be helpful for you. We're gonna go back to this at the end when we do a little bit of an icebreaker, where you find out how your answers might be similar or different to others. Um, who's finished that task? Oh yeah, um, so maybe I'll wait, uh, 5 minutes. I And actually most people have their laptop here.

SPEAKER 1
like But T everything's off my desk.

SPEAKER 0
You probably do on your phone. It's a bit hard to click through Blackboard though. And you would struggle with the Tutorials I pulling up now. My laptop's glued to me. I have it. Alright, so, um, uh, you can continue writing while I'm talking, but I'd be curious to see the distribution of the courses that people are doing. Um, so who here is a postgraduate student? Who here, so hands down, who here is an undergraduate student? No, so I think we're all, uh wait one, yeah. So uh a few undergrads do this course as well, it's predominantly postgrad. Um, how many people are doing a masters of uh data science? No, computer science. OK, so mostly computer science, um, some form of engineering. Fewer, uh, interaction design, lots as well. Uh, what have I missed? IT, OK, and IT. And any others? So I think it was predominantly masters of Computer Science, uh, and then closely followed. Almost evenly between the other three, not sure if you guys got to see those hands, but there are many other people in the same. Degree as you, so you're not alone, um, perhaps, uh, I think there was only one or two hands that went up for a bachelor. Of um Uh, undergraduate. So you're welcome to keep uh continuing this um perhaps it'd be interesting to see some of those answers around uh how research methods could be helpful for you. Um, how many people here said because it's a requirement of my degree. Mhm. Yeah, that that that's acceptable, yeah.

SPEAKER 4
I just, you know, software engineering there's going to be R&D involved with that and so I assume some of the skills that we learn here will be transferable.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, um, so that comment was around how in software engineering, hopefully some of the skills learned here, um, would actually be transferable. Um, did anyone have any comments on how they think it could be useful to them?

SPEAKER 1
No one thinks it's useful.

SPEAKER 0
That's it. And, yeah. Did, did you have a comment?

SPEAKER 1
OK.

SPEAKER 0
Who here thinks it will improve their writing skills? So some people who think it will improve their oral communication skills. Um, who thinks it might help them in something like commercialization or entrepreneurship? Not many people, oh, a couple people, um. Uh, so there are some aspects to the course that cover that. Uh, who thinks it will help them coming up with research ideas? Yeah, some people. Who thinks it will help them find a supervisor for their thesis. Some people put their hands up. Yeah. Great. Um, so I think hopefully we do cover aspects of those. Um, so hopefully we'll be able to provide you with your aims or the, that the purpose you have. Um, we're also open to suggestions. If you have something that you see that's not in the list that you critically want covered, um, we may be able to incorporate that as well. OK. Let me just quickly check how many slides before, OK, we're almost up to the, the break. OK, so one other aspect of this course is, uh, I guess academic integrity. Um, and so probably all of you are familiar with something called generative AI in particular, things like chat GPT, uh, and all of the related ones. So whether it's clawed, whether it's, um, Grok, uh, what are the other ones, uh, Gemini. What else do people use, uh, copilot, um, so Microsoft co-pilot. Um, so these are tools that are becoming available. Turns out now if you're not aware of these things, you're living under a rock. Um, so even high school students and perhaps even primary school students are aware of these things and using them to help them in their learning and also sometimes for assessment. So in terms of this course, um we. Uh, do not allow it during tutorials, and that's because it's all about your own contributions and what you know personally. Um, however, for your assignments, you are allowed to use it with proper attribution. So I'm gonna show you on the next slide what I mean by proper attribution. Um, so I'm very happy for you to use it, and I've noticed actually, in fact, it improves a lot of people's writing skills. So for example, you might go, Uh, let's say just chat GPT. Here's a paragraph I've written. Can you please improve the grammar and make it sound more professional. So you're allowed to use that, but to avoid any issues with academic integrity, you must cite your use and how you used it. So in particular what version you used and um also sometimes what prompts you used as well. Um, and so Even though I've had this policy in a lot of my courses, sometimes people do not attribute it correctly, so you are allowed for the assignments subject to appropriate referencing, um, as an example, I've seen people who leave, Uh, there was this one assignment last year, a student submitted, it says, here is where you should include a table, and here is where you should include a plot to support your answer. That was the text inside their assignment. So, uh, if you're using it, make sure to do it properly. What you're submitting. Is your work and so you need to be proud of your work, you need to be responsible for your work, um, and you need to check your work. So you are allowed to use these tools, in fact, they're very good, but you need to make sure that it's your own work and also that you cite it correctly. Some things to be aware of is that In terms of all the studies, you learn a lot better by attempting things yourself. There was a study performed, I think it was last year or the year before, around, um, some of these emerging large language models, and, uh, I think people used either chat GBTs, so they were allowed to use it and actually they were forced to use it. And then, um, other people used a, maybe a lesser uh large language model, and then one where they were not allowed to use large language models where they were only allowed to use Google search. When it was time for the assessment to be graded, it turns out the people who used C ChaiBT actually got the highest grades. Um, the people in using a slightly lower, uh, large language model performed slightly worse, and the ones who just used the Google search actually performed the lowest. However, when they were tested on that, um, later in the semester, turns out the tables were turned. The people who used um Google Search and did the tasks themselves actually had much better retention of knowledge and performed way better than the people who are using these tools. Um, and the ones who used, uh, Chat GBT actually had zero recollection of the things that they supposedly got, you know, exceptional grades for. So make sure if you're using these tools that you still engage your brain because this is all about learning. Um, you're not gonna be able to improve your personal skills if you don't put the effort in. Um, so you can use these tools to support your learning, but make sure that you're still learning. Um, there's a couple of other things as well. So there's hallucination, uh, problems, uh, so if that means that it can produce things that appear like facts, reads beautifully, but they're actually false. You need to check primary sources and make sure what you put in is actually true. As an example, there might be references that are completely made up. Um, that actually happens very frequently, um, so Karl's probably observed it a lot in thesis. actually as well too, so people would uh.

SPEAKER 3
Put in, I wanna build a circuit that does this, they get something back which is physically impossible to build, and then they spend weeks trying to do it. And then they come and ask the tutors or or the lecturers and we go, yeah, that's, you did this on chat tutors didn't you?

SPEAKER 0
So, um, that is very, very common. So it'll, you know, fabricate, uh, circuits, um, URLs, and even information. So you need to verify that. Same as, you know, back in the day when Wikipedia was first introduced, people used to just copy their whole assignment from there and um not cite it. Um, so this is a new tool that enables you to sometimes do things faster and better, but you need to make sure that it's actually correct. Um, also, it might have knowledge cutoffs, and it doesn't do correct citation, so be careful with plagiarism. And the other thing is, if, uh, you're using it, for example, in your work, like in industry or even in academia, there's various policies around this, um, so some people do not allow it because it can leak intellectual property. So the things that you put into there, you have to assume that it's not private, because even when Chachi BT first came out, people's messages were becoming publicly available. They are also used to train the next generation of these models. So, um, make sure to consider that before putting anything that is, uh, supposed to be private. Um, in our assignments we're gonna give you guidance on how to actually site generative AI. There's a link here from the UQ library around how to actually cite. Um, the key thing is to cite that you used it and how you used it. So this is a sample from last semester's assignment, um, and so you just do a tick box of how. Used it. Uh, I expect probably, you know, 90% of you are going to be using it to improve your grammar. That's OK. Just, you know, say which version you used and, uh, how you used it. So grammar and style, perhaps you used it for planning or drafting, um, maybe used it for some graphics in your presentation assignment too. Uh, just state how you used it. So, you know, maybe use mid journey. So when you used it, and what version and what you used it for. Any questions?

SPEAKER 1
Yep. So it's totally fine to not use any.

SPEAKER 0
Correct, yes. um, so saying that, um, so I've said, you know, if you're using it, this is how to cite it, but you are also completely OK with not using it and um. Just writing your own words, so that is completely acceptable as well. So you are not required to use generative AI just many people are using it, um, and this is how to use it, uh, responsibly and correctly. Good question. Um, so here's a summary of the main messages, um, and we're gonna have a short break now, so you're free to stand up, stretch your legs, get a drink of water. Um, there's a toilet just outside there as well, um, and we'll regroup it back in about, uh, 5 minutes, so by 1:05. Thanks everyone. So feel free to talk amongst yourselves as well. I could start the 2nd.

SPEAKER 1
We had one Yeah One group of guys, the circuit

SPEAKER 3
was produced, shorted out the rechargeable battery. And they were wondering why the battery was getting hot and not. Luckily Jeremy picked a battery which had a a a thermal control unit in it, so it got too hot. He would just cut the thing otherwise it'd just catch

SPEAKER 1
it.

SPEAKER 0
It's also in a lot of the programming courses, so people, I think often it does work but it's like way more complicated than anything they've been taught.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, or, or I love it when it it it it invents new Python libraries which do exactly what you

SPEAKER 3
want.

SPEAKER 1
I was having a look. Research about microwaving, imaging on brain injuries, and I find that fascinating.

SPEAKER 0
I want to ask you if I can be my supervisor with you or how that works. I haven't got any projects at the moment listed around that topic, but the environment would be awesome as well. Send me an email, um, say that you talk to me as well, um, say what your main interests are,

SPEAKER 1
um, yeah, yeah, because I work with, um, work as well, yeah, and um I've worked with this patient who well and he has seizure, so I was. Thinking about something that could predict like the decision because it can like it suddenly drop, it's like maybe like a wavelength or something like that. There's lots of different modalities to look for in that space and uh my colleague Lee, um, we actually have

SPEAKER 0
some joint projects and he actually works for me as

SPEAKER 1
the tomography and um so like. feel free to message me. I'm currently supposed to be supervision, but I'm willing to have a chat with my 1st 2 years before I start my work was the most. Alright, cool, definitely, um, so I, I will try to

SPEAKER 0
get back to you soon thanks.

SPEAKER 1
I, I send an email to professors but yes, so

SPEAKER 0
in the assignments, there's assignment 1 and assignment 2, we'll provide you with this. It's probably you might be identical to this and you

SPEAKER 1
say exactly this, so the orange part is and they'll be part of the, yeah, so the reason we have

SPEAKER 0
that is for you to keep up to date with it. In the past it used to be assessed straight at the end of the week, the week, sorry, um, but now it's all part of the.

SPEAKER 1
It's just it's seen the emails it's alright to have them in parallel we've only done one. Yeah I think I was doing the thing that 3D

SPEAKER 3
printing stuff's really cool, so don't worry, that's a good

SPEAKER 1
project. If you get something it'd be really awesome. I think there's a good chance you'll see I just like that's right. That's fine. This is how this works. You're gonna go and see a bunch of different things and work out what's the best for you. So like that's what I like like the the yeah, so you need to do. So like for the election there's like are there like any sheet for the for the lectures. Ask Lena for the. Sorry, they'll be as part of the sign. So I've just ask your reflection. All of your activities, so all the details.

SPEAKER 0
I can show you last year's as an example, but um.

SPEAKER 1
question among the like kind of like like 30, 100, so like we can, uh, weekly courier and do the

SPEAKER 3
like. Yeah, it's sort of like it's sort of like getting you to do stuff when, when, when things are happening and then you use that material for the assignment too and be marked the end of the week to keep

SPEAKER 0
up to date. Material, otherwise you're gonna forget and your reflection needs to

SPEAKER 1
be a reflection of, you know, for example, has your

SPEAKER 0
opinion changed from when you've written something because your what might change, so it's all about that reflection. So here's an example. This was last, uh, semester's assignment. So you can see the aim of it is to review, summarise, and reflect on the ideas, blah blah blah, and you submit the presentations and the report. Um, and then the task is pick three topics and summarise them. So this was the lectures and Corresponding tutorial and you pick 3, and you do a critical analysis, you connect the topics and you do a short summary of it. Um, so it turns out in the end you're only gonna have to pick 3, but you need to have enough content there for you to be able to, so

SPEAKER 1
like the lecture journal be like marked directly right?

SPEAKER 0
you'll you'll add it to your report and it'll only be 3 of them, but it's better if you have

SPEAKER 1
you. Thanks. Yeah I Yeah, I don't too bad the room size. You're gonna have to get a bigger room. No, don't turn up. I can't do that. The thing is I've got a lecture just before it,

SPEAKER 0
uh, just upstairs, so it'd be convenient to just be

SPEAKER 1
here, not have to run across campus.

SPEAKER 0
Did you, uh, I attended the TNL meeting yesterday.

SPEAKER 1
They were saying that business school was the one that takes up, but they have like 1500. It's almost as bad as the entire like engineering field for like one subject. should I show you the last year's probably yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Alright everyone, um, so let's get back into it. Um, so great to have lots of conversation and excitement about the course, or maybe it's just about meeting new people, that's OK as well.

SPEAKER 1
Yes. Right. So. I OK, so now we're gonna jump into the second

SPEAKER 0
part of the lecture today, which is around introducing the themes and topics of the course. So I want to start off with a bit of a reflection around how does research differ from learning a new topic. So if you think about it, um, perhaps most people think or know that research is about something new. But there are differences to just learning a new topic. So, uh, I just got your attention, but, uh, if you could just, uh, discuss this question with the person next to you. So what do you think is the difference between research and learning a new topic? Sometimes it might have a bit of overlap, but there are distinctions in research, so perhaps we have some core themes that can come out of this. So just turn around to your nearest, uh, partner who's sitting next to you. Um, so, and just discuss this amongst yourselves.

SPEAKER 3
The quietest room we've had so far.

SPEAKER 1
I don't hear much talking. He shouldn't have done this last. Hindsight is always very nice. I actually asked LGBT and I asked it, yeah, and it's got a great one.

SPEAKER 0
Well, like I didn't really think about it before doing it. I was just like, yeah, what is it?

SPEAKER 1
It's actually really good. We had some really good discussions about the gender of AI and thesis part B. I spoke with Janet had some really good good stuff. I can't believe that people. That's. These circuits, it's like that's, it's like it's like the stuff you do before you. Yeah, I know, never occurred.

SPEAKER 3
Like they made a PCB and it doesn't work.

SPEAKER 1
It's like why doesn't it work? And it was a really tricky thing because like they've obviously generated the whole thing. Like the the the the the the the Gerber file

SPEAKER 3
or whatever it is in there, because like, it was like a hidden via that was shorting.

SPEAKER 1
How many layers of the 2. Yeah, was that like underneath a component or something like that.

SPEAKER 0
I wonder if they changed anything out of it, like debugging skills or or not really hard to tell.

SPEAKER 1
right. Yeah OK.

SPEAKER 0
Um, I'm gonna select some people from the audience. Um, we promised that the first row would not be asked. So I'm gonna go up to the middle. I'm gonna pick the person who's not looking at me.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Yeah Hello, I'm gonna pick on you.

SPEAKER 0
So, um, what did you answer for this question? So what was, yeah, yeah, um, was there anything that you agreed on was the difference?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah More. Yep, yep, yep, yeah, great, great, excellent.

SPEAKER 0
Um, how about you?

SPEAKER 1
I. Thank. Yeah Yes, yes.

SPEAKER 0
Excellent, excellent answer, excellent. Um, so it sounds like a lot of people have really um thought about this really well. Um, and in fact, um, I asked Chat GBT this morning what it thought about this. So the difference between research and learning a new topic, and interestingly here, um, so you can see that I've actually cited chat GPT on my slide at the bottom. And the prompt I used was, how does research differ from learning a new topic. And it actually produced this beautiful table comparing research to learning a new topic. So I've colour coded that research in green, learning a new topic in blue, and you can see there's various aspects that it compares it to. And just with that quick, um, uh, walk through the class, um, a lot of people actually said exactly the same thing. You're all using chat.

SPEAKER 1
All looking at his life.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, that's great as well. Um, so some people, uh, maybe use To GBT, but I, I actually saw people who, uh, got this themselves as well. There's some people who also are very studious and uh. And read uh the lecture slides where the answer was revealed, at least Chay BT's answer, but I actually agree with um a lot of that's on here. So there's different purpose. So what you can see with research is it's actually that new or novelness about it. So it's something generating new knowledge. Whereas learning a new topic, it might be new to you, but it already exists. So, you know, if you're trying to study something, that information already exists when you're learning a new topic for you. Then the approach, you know, I, I, I talked to a few people up there, it might be things like studying textbooks or online resources where, you know, the key thing is it already kind of exists, um, and, you know, different sources you might use and then different processes as well. Um, and so for those of you who, some people also said that, you know, research is a new concept to them. So that's OK as well, but you can see that it's actually sometimes it doesn't exist. Um, there's actually a beautiful quote attributed to Albert Einstein where, um, if we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it? Um, so it's about that newness. Um, so here we have an example, so researchers, uh, example would be conducting an experiment to test how sleep affects memory retention. Whereas learning could be about reading about sleep cycles and memory formation, for example, in a textbook, for example, a psychology textbook, this was from Chat GPT, so it's suggested that. Um, so you can see learning is about absorbing or learning, I can't use the same word in the definition, and research is about questioning and expanding it. Um, so now, this course is called research methods, so the first component of that is research. And so now hopefully you have a better understanding of what we mean by research. So it's that discovering of new information through various, uh, techniques. And so research methods is actually about the techniques or strategies we have, um, to collect, analyse and interpret uh data. Um, to answer research questions, um, or test hypo hypotheses to generate new knowledge. Um, and so in different fields there are various different research methods. Um, and so it it's all about these techniques that are very domain specific, um, so the theories, the methods and technologies used, uh, the various analysis methods, and even the style of writing those up. Um, there's a quote here from, uh, Percy Bridgeman on the scientific method that there are as many scientific methods as there are individual scientists. So, uh, there, it's very much a personal thing, however, there are some commonalities that relate to various disciplines. Um, so in terms of generic research skills, um, that's what we hope to teach you, so you all will be able to apply it to your specific disciplines, whether that is for your, um, benefit in industry or some future research projects you do. So it actually relates to all things from planning out a project through to actually You go about reading, summarising literature, uh, synthesising ideas, um, performing literature reviews, how you go about writing, and then how you go about presenting that. So whether that's through a seminar, poster, conference, demos, and even things like, uh, time management can be included in research skills. So our goals in this course are to give you some ideas and tools that will help you uh with research and particularly because it's uh supposed to prepare you for thesis, things and that will help you with your uh projects and uh thesis. Um, so projects and theses are a different style of activity from traditional engineering and computing courses, um, and in particular we saw that when we were reflecting on the difference between research and learning something new, um, that there are differences in how you go about that. Um, and so in research, you'll actually be pursuing original or novel ideas. And the critical thing here is actually that things don't progress linearly. So if you look at the top right-hand corner here, um, so on the x-axis we have time and effort, and we expect that our progress will be linear. So like the more time you put in and the more effort you put in, that the more you're going to get out. But in research, it doesn't actually typically work this way. Um, so there's this, uh, famous diagram here. So this is the start, this is the end, and you'd see that it's not a straight line at all. It's actually this squiggle, um, and research is right here at the start in amongst that crazy squiggle. Um, and so that's how, uh, projects usually progress and there's, uh, also a related concept around the hype cycles. This is called Damien Newman's Design squiggle. So this is how you go about designing, whether it's a project, even if it's a, you know, a work of art, um, but there's that research or syn synthesis stage, which is the most difficult, um, in terms of there isn't a clear direction of how to get there. If you think about. Most of your university courses and schooling, it's, you get a task and you just do it. You follow instructions, you follow, basically a given procedure, and you get an answer which is typically right or wrong. In research methods and in research, uh, eventually you'll, um, focus on that final output, but the weight that you get there is actually very messy. Um, so there's some beautiful TED talks about this as well, where maybe originally you're trying to aim for this. So you start at location A, you're aiming to get to B, so that's, you know, what you expect, or your hypothesis. You do your research and, you know, you try lots of things, they don't work, you try different things, and then it turns out sometimes you end up in a completely different Different location from what you originally expected, so you end up in location C. and you're expanding that knowledge. Um, so some people would have seen that, uh, analogy of the circle with, you know, the world's knowledge. And, uh, when you do research, what you're doing is in a tiny little speck, you're pushing the boundary of what's known. Um, and so that's kind of that example. Um, another analogy that can be useful thinking about research and emerging technologies is this hype cycle. Um, so you can see this again is not really a linear curve. Um, on the X-axis here we have time, and on the, uh, Y axis we have expectations. And you can see various different disciplines, uh, mostly related to artificial intelligence, AI, um, around where they are in this hype cycle. One thing that you can see that is sometimes a little bit challenging is that there's a peak and. It drops. So they call us the trough of disillusionment. And so sometimes doing research is actually quite challenging because you have to get through these troughs. Um, for example, in AI, we had the AI winter where there was no funding in the, uh, research for. AI, and then suddenly there's a massive boom, and now everyone's doing it. Um, whether there's going to be another one, it's hard to say. Um, but there's these hype cycles that you also have to manage as part of research, where it's not linear, but, um, you know, sometimes on these, uh, curves that are kind of hard to manage. So in terms of the different stages of the cycle, there's 5 key phases, so innovation trigger, there might be a new breakthrough in technology, um, and people develop these proof of concepts, um, and there isn't yet that much interest in the area or expectation around things. Then there's that peak of inflated expectations that is the top of those expectations. So typically there's lots of publicity around that uh area and um. Uh, not only that, but there's also lots of failures. So if you think of autonomous vehicles, you might remember that many years ago, Elon Musk said that, you know, full self-driving is just 2 years away. Um, that was now, I think, 5 to 7 years ago, um, and we don't yet have full self-driving cars, so it's about managing those expectations. Um, and that's when sometimes you hit that trough of disillusionment and so the interest and experiments may, um, Reduce and fail to deliver, and then there's that slope of entitlement where with more and more research and more and more time, um things start to work and then you get that plateau plateau of productivity. Um this is just one way that things work, um, there's many, many other ways. So now what is research? So it doesn't have a simple definition. Uh, we've talked a little bit about how research might differ from, you know, learning a new concept, um, and it doesn't really have that easy definition or really, it's not really about common sense. And so when you're doing a research project, you'll actually be learning how to do research. Um, how do you do an excellent research project? Um, so usually it helps to have some kind of mentorship. At university, if you're doing a thesis or a capstone project or, uh, similar, you'll typically be guided by a supervisor. So it's kind of like that apprentice model where you know someone has a lot of knowledge in the field and guides, uh, someone new to the area. Um, and sometimes you can use checklists to help yourself along the way. Now we've got activity too, so if you still have that uh tab open on your computers, this activity now is around what is the difference between studying an undergraduate course where the material is already established and known and conducting research. Um, so I think we've covered most of that, so I've provided some guidance. Note that that was just a, Almost drag copy paste from Chat GBT. So you should also think of your own kind of independent thoughts there, um, when you're thinking about this. So perhaps you have some more interesting, uh, differences that you think of here. So, does anyone have anything that differs from that previous slide about the difference between an undergraduate course where the material is already established and known versus conducting research? Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Well, typically, um, like at least like level one undergraduate courses. The um the field of interest is could potentially be like 50 or 200 years old, like the example civil engineering hydraulics, like a lot of that base theory is,

SPEAKER 0
yeah. Yeah, so, um, some of the theory in undergraduate courses is 50 to 100 years old, so it doesn't necessarily change. Interestingly, sometimes the field does change. So I know with chemistry, um, back in high school, like, there's changes with like the addition of the knowledge of new types of particles, um, that weren't in old textbooks. So sometimes it changes. Yeah, sometimes it changes. Um, But yes, and typically if it's something that it doesn't change because it's just a fact. Yeah, anyone else? I guess I've touched on this already, um, so. I think in a lot of undergraduate courses. You know, the material is known, but also it's very much told you what to do, rather than you having to find it yourself. Um, so not only do you not know the answer, but I think also typically you don't even know the questions when doing research. And actually one of the first parts of doing research is establishing what your research questions are. So I think that's actually a very big difference compared to, um, undergraduate or even postgraduate courses. You are actually establishing your own questions. Does anyone else have any other ideas? Now here I've got some hints on how to actually answer such a broad question which doesn't have any obvious correct answers. So, um, here is a copy of that same question. So what is the difference between studying an undergraduate course where the material is already established and known and conducting research? There's a lot of words there, um, so typically what you do when you're presented with something without an obvious answer is you actually break it down into the logical parts. Um, for example, you might start with a sentence on the parts that you know, and then compare them. So here I've just colour coordinated that. So you might start with, for example, describing the characteristics of the course where material is already established. So for almost everyone here, actually everyone here, you have done an undergraduate courses before. So you are very familiar with this, hopefully. Um, so you know what those characteristics are, and you should be able to, um, write those down or at least have some idea about it. So then you look at the other parts of the sentence, conducting research. So there you might need to actually research what research is about, uh, and, um, write those characteristics there and define what those are. And then the critical part of the question is to actually, Uh, describe that difference, so there are colour coordinated that in green, and so then once you've broken that down, so something you're familiar with, something that you could research, you write those down, and then you explain the difference. Um, so this is all about kind of coming up with your own ideas as well. Um, so next week we're gonna have a, uh, guest lecture. We've still got to figure out how we schedule it in, but, um, from the, uh, embedded language support officer, Stuart Crosby, he's actually gonna be helping in, in terms of teaching how you synthesise your own ideas. So how you go from not just taking someone else's text. And just copy pasting it, but how you go about coming up with your own ideas. It's a little bit related to this where, you know, perhaps you might not know about this, and so you might just resort to, you know, finding the information, putting it in, but you can see here, for example, it's all about that difference. So you have to actually use a bit of your own thinking and compare these things. You could even perhaps use some online tools to do a comparison, for example, ask, uh, you know, Google these things, maybe it already exists online, but then you need to come up with your own ideas as well, particularly in the form of a journal where it's all about your own reflection and synthesis. Right, so I'm now gonna go into a bit of a research checklist. So this is from uh Zobel, writing for Computer science, which is hopefully relevant to many of you, I think when I asked what degree people were doing, the majority of hands went up for masters of Computer Science. Um, so this is, I think it's a 14 point checklist, but I'll see in the next slides. Um, so the checklist is, are the project or thesis ideas clear and consistent? Is the problem worthy of investigation? Does the project have appropriate scope? So that's how much you're looking at. Um, what are the research questions? As I mentioned before, when we were talking about that previous slide, compared to, for example, undergraduate courses, research, you actually have to establish your own questions, not only the answers. Um, then you also have to think about a hypothesis. Um, does everyone here know what a hypothesis is? So I think, um, many people put their hands up. Um, so a hypothesis is what you expect to happen. So typically when you're doing some form of research, you kind of have an expectation of what you already think that might come from other research you've done or maybe your own preconceptions, but you have some guess of how things are gonna go, and you need to be able to test it. So the next question is around, how would you disprove the hypothesis? Um, and then you have to think about any assumptions you have, and then you have to go through your approach and critically review that. Um, then you have to think about the outcomes and how it's been evaluated, and when you're working in a team, you also have to think about the different responsibilities there and how you work together. Um, other things like any weaknesses in the approach or outcomes, um, the research plan, and then the evidence and data, and it turns out we have 3 more items. So the milestones, so when you're coming up with a project, you come up with your research questions. Your outcomes that you're hoping to achieve, which is guided by your hypotheses and then milestones, how you're going to get there. Even though there isn't already an answer, there are existing methodologies that people use to help them get to the answer. So there might be experiments you perform with various benchmarks. So for example, in computer science and. Um, maybe related more to my field of, uh, machine learning. There's lots of publicly available data sets. You can evaluate your new technique on those data sets, you can pair against what's called baselines and state of the art techniques, and you can pair how your method performs against others. Um, so you might have some steps of how you get there. That's what I mean by those milestones. And then there's deadlines, so you have to put some kind of timeline when you're doing a big research project. And also very critically is that literature review, understanding what already exists, um, and understanding that, because it's very hard and almost impossible to come up with something new if you don't have a good understanding of what's already out there, um, so that can guide. What exists, but also what research questions and challenges still remain. Um, I know many people in their PhDs, you know, they've been working on something for several months, sometimes a year, and they get up to their first milestone where they need to confirm their PhD. Um, the field moves on from when you start. Sometimes people only do a literature review at the beginning, and then they just double check the literature as they're doing a report, for example, and turns out new things exist, and sometimes your idea can sometimes feel like it's been poached, um, or people might contradict some of the things that you're looking at. So it's very important to keep up to date with literature. The other thing I said in the previous slide was that the best way to learn how to do your research is actually by doing it. So yes, you're guided by someone typically like a supervisor and uh other lab mates sometimes, um, sometimes also your colleagues. There are a number of important things to learn and achieve. So some of those include integrity and honesty in the research. So sometimes you might have some findings, you really want to be right, but then turns out you look back at some of your assumptions, and they might not be right, you need to be actually very, Truthful in the way you you report your results, for example, if you're comparing it against baselines, uh, and other techniques, you need to compare them fairly. You can't just go, OK, I'm gonna make these parameters all really bad for the other techniques, and then turns out mine is the best, um, so you need to actually do that uh with honesty. Um, so that's in research, but also in terms of academic integrity, you can't just claim other people's work as your own. What does that mean? If you find some, even text on the uh internet, you put it in, you don't cite it, that is not being, um. Uh, not, uh, displaying our integrity. Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
I think, yeah, it's just important to highlight, there's also value in knowing about something that doesn't work.

SPEAKER 0
Yes. So the, the comment there for people who didn't hear, there's value in knowing the techniques that don't work. Um, sometimes this is called negative results. Um, sometimes it's hard to publish this, so it depends on the field, but in, um, I know, especially psychology, they actually very much promote. Publishing negative results, where you pre-register a study where you had a particular hypothesis and aims, um, and then maybe it didn't work, it didn't show what you expected, and you still publish that because it can help other people, uh, to know that that technique didn't work. Um, and I think it's actually something that should be more, more strongly encouraged, um, not just publishing positive results and beating people by 0.1%, um, but actually, you know, sharing when things don't work, even if that's in the form of, you know, blog post or something like that. Uh, so doing background research, so things like uh preparing an annotated bibliography and a literature review. Um, these are all concepts that we're gonna be covering in this course. So finding and defining a topic and presenting it in a document called a proposal, presenting a seminar on your research progress, demonstrating your work in a poster, and completing a final project report. Um, and in fact, uh, all these get assessed in, um, the thesis. So if you end up doing a Thesis as part of your degree, you will actually do research and demonstrate research methods, skills, as well as your ability in research, um, and all of these different concepts. So we'll be actually covering many of these topics, starting from integrity, uh, annotated bibliography and literature reviews. We'll also be covering some metrics there, proposals, seminars, and so forth. Now what do you need to do for excellent research? So this is targeted more at the thesis, but we'd have to, as, uh, academics and educators come up with a way to assess, uh, thesis, theses, um, and so we have criteria of how we define that as being excellent. So things such as, you know, innovation, uh, presentations. Skills, writing ability, um, appropriate literature review and background. Um, so they tell you what's needed in terms of criteria, but it doesn't tell you how to do that. We're hoping in this course to help a little bit in some of the techniques. Like I said before, every single researcher might have their own techniques, but there's some commonalities in those, and that's what we're trying to convey to you in this course. And so creating a plan helps in terms of guiding that process, and another thing you can do is if you do have a mark sheet is you can convert that into a little checklist. So other topics we'll be covering, so those highlighted the majority of them, but another thing that's really critical in research is, you know, you could come up with the best ideas, but if you don't share them with the world, that research is not gonna progress or make any benefit and impact to the world. So communication is actually a really, really critical skill in research. Um, so that goes all the way from being able to read literature through to writing and sharing your research, and then even, you know, disseminating that more broadly through oral presentations. Um, so that could be just for, you know, sharing research and getting. Research field up to date, but it could even be in um a format of getting funding to support your research. So, you know, if you're in entrepreneurship, maybe you're trying to get funding um to support doing further research or even translation to get that impact into the real world. Um, and so you'll be communicating with us, whether it's by emails or a discussion, um, I've provided some guidance on how to write emails more formally, um, but also you're gonna be doing, um, these as part of your assignments and tutorial activities. Alright, so the last activity we have for today is an icebreaker. I know you've already had a chance to chat with your neighbours, um, but this is really important to get to know one another, because, um, you'll get to know each other in the tutorials, but also, um, this really kind of helps not feel alone in this course, just finding out, um, the people around you, um, here in the lecture, um, so, you know, meet three new people you haven't met before. Um, so if you're sitting with your friends, try to maybe turn around and go to the row behind or in front of you, or if you know everyone, perhaps maybe move around the room, um, and find out what are these people's names, what's their field of study. Maybe it's the same as yours, and also related back to that first activity we did, why did they want to take the course? Um, did it match you, did it match kind of what I was saying before, that it's a compulsory course, or is there something else that is um there?

SPEAKER 1
I I should tell them I'm gonna do a friend check my. I don't think that that's, that's, that's like a generation. What what's it falling now, is it or is it just one side? Just, just. Yeah, that'd be even more nerdy. WeChat WeChat. I. Yeah. Cool. That's good. Thanks for your. I do that. It helps. Yeah, I'm actually quite surprised how it's good.

SPEAKER 0
And last time we had a lecture theatre it was a bit awkward because like the. Tables, I think there's liberal, um, so there's two lecture theatres joined together in the middle with those collaborative tables.

SPEAKER 1
So you're in the middle of two separate rooms and um that's what it's gonna be like that's what the that should be like for. Yeah, it's just really hard to pick where that is, um, and interestingly here, even though it's really packed and way too busy, um, it's actually Still, you've only got. Do you think anyone came here and then turned around see what probably is is they saw that. timetables. They really went, Oh, that number and this number don't match. So they'd actually get away with one or two. I know we talked about. It's gonna be hard because you know what will happen.

SPEAKER 3
You'll get exactly like 2 more people than you've got

SPEAKER 1
space. The real challenge is they've given us a Wednesday lecture. Well, you look at the 2 hour gaps on the whole it's OK. And if you said people have got clashes with all of those options, that's also. Yeah, someone requested on the end like, oh, how about

SPEAKER 0
a Tuesday, like I said, oh, what time would work

SPEAKER 1
for you by Tuesday, but that doesn't mean I and you don't want to have a week. Well, we could do it 15 years. And the I actually got more material and I like and actually do the tutorials with previous week and doesn't really work that well no it doesn't and then and then you have one public holiday last year we had like 22. Yeah, it's not too bad no so we had to. I think everyone's actually great. Yes, yeah, we have to fabricate something. I see how this this will work here, but I understand why it may not work with this. Because there's no assessment. Yeah. So there is a lecture after this, so um we need to make sure we like the. I just don't understand it. I still don't know how we're gonna have to do a thesis.

SPEAKER 3
Con doesn't seem too worried, but he's done this enough time, but like I'm going to take you on the

SPEAKER 1
other side. Ask me to stop and then go to or I got a different topic.

SPEAKER 3
Obviously I'm doing something wrong with right, depending on how

SPEAKER 1
you want to. I've got a lot of emails I think I must have sent in saying you know I I like a lot of those emails one guys I said sending emails and those. Because I don't think that's. Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Right, did everyone manage to meet 3 people? Did you manage to meet 3 people? Yeah. And you got it in your journal. Excellent. Some commonalities. Was there some commonalities?

SPEAKER 1
OK, excellent.

SPEAKER 0
And you haven't met before?

SPEAKER 1
OK. Yeah, they're great. Yeah. And did you guys manage to meet 3 people? Yeah, nice, nice. You're in a good position there. Hey, did you manage to get 3 people? Yeah, nice smooth.

SPEAKER 0
So did everyone manage to find 3 people? Yeah, excellent. Um, did you manage to find 3 people? Did you manage to find 3 people? Yes, this way or the behind also here or along the way?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, great, great.

SPEAKER 0
Um, any commonalities? Are you guys doing the same degree?

SPEAKER 1
Different, OK, interesting. I So. I Oh Yes. Oh. I. Oh. Alright, so I've just gone around the room.

SPEAKER 0
It looks like most people have completed that activity. Um, so you're welcome to stay and finish that activity here and input it into your journals. Make sure to click post entry at the bottom. So if you have your journal. Yeah. So at the very bottom there's a part that says post entry, so make sure to click that before you finish, so you can see what that looks like. Goes through and you can see here, um it's just posted that there, so it's called lecture one. if for example, you didn't have enough time to to complete one of the activities, um, you can go back here, click on it, um, you can add a comment or you can go here and click edit. Um, so that was in the Q&A during the lecture, but um, that's just a quick demo there. So, um, make sure to do that there. Um, so that's it for today's lecture. Um, the last slide is just a reminder that tutorials start next week, so that's the first of your assessed tutorial participation activities as part of your 30% assessment. So make sure to sign up to a tutorial contact session, double check the room and ensure you're on time. Um, I'm gonna make sure that we finish these lectures with enough time to get to those rooms because, uh, tutorial one and tutorial 2 are straight after this starting next week. Um, it turns out some people have not been able to allocate into a class. We have a new time, uh, timetabled class on its way. I will email as soon as that becomes available, um, and so make sure to sign up for that. Um, and, uh, good luck for the semester. Um, hope you enjoy research methods. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the discussion, and I'll be here for the next few minutes as well. Thanks everyone.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Yeah.
